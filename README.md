# EuroStemCell Data Doantion

This is a Mozilla Firefox Extension designed to collect data from Google's web search for a cooperative research project of TU Kaiserslautern's Algorithm Accountability Lab, University of Edinburgh's MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine and EuroStemCell.

Our browser plug-in allows you to participate in our project to analyze black box scrutinization of publicly and socially relevant algorithms. The Plugin automatically submits search queries to Google up to six times a day, the results of which are automatically sent to a University server in Kaiserslautern Germany. 
First, you will have to fill in a demographic survey to provide some statistical data and allow us to assign you to a study with respective settings such as a set of keywords and the URL of a search provider. 
The plugin sends the query along with the current settings of the plugin, and a study ID. To do this, a tab must be opened, which closes again after  retrieving the data. The plugin then sends details such as URL, title and content on web search results, advertising and top stories.
Taking part in the study is free and will not be compensated. You contribute to a scientific cause and results will be provided to the public with an open source licence.

If you would like to participate, please download the plugin, fill in a demographic survey and join the project!
